# `gmail-clj`

A Clojure library designed to abstract the details of the GMail REST API: [developers.google.com/gmail/api/](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/)

## Installation

`gmail-clj` is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/gmail-clj):

![](https://clojars.org/gmail-clj/latest-version.svg)

## Usage

Require the library in your REPL:

```clojure
  (require '[gmail-clj.core :as gmail])
```

...or in your project.clj file

```clojure
  (ns my-app.core
    (:require [gmail-clj.core :as gmail]))
```

Be sure to set your Google API Application Key and Secret:

```clojure
  (gmail/set-client-secret! "aaaaa")
  (gmail/set-client-id! "bbbbbb")
  (gmail/set-refresh-token! "ccccc")
  (gmail/set-access-token! "dddddd") ; Optional. If you already have an access token.
```

## Authorizing

This library takes your API information and will do an authorization based on a refresh token. (*Note: If your app doesn't request a refresh token, you can simply set the access-token with gmail/set-access-token!, but we can't re-authorize after that token expires without a refresh token.*)

To generate the refresh token you need to write your own interface with the Google OAuth endpoint, but for development and testing I've included an HTML file that does the basic OAuth handshake and returns the refresh token: [/resources/index.html](https://github.com/mikeflynn/gmail-clj/blob/master/resources/index.html).

## API methods

All API calls return a [Manifold deferred](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold) which you can `deref` as the simplest operation.

Errors are Manifold `error-deferred` containing an `ExceptionInfo` with the response status as the message and the whole response as the `ex-data`. 

## Messages

```clojure
@(message-get "14f93683f441c8e4")

;; or use some manifold async goodness

(-> (d/chain (message-get "14f93683f441c8e4")
             #(-> % :payload :body :data))
    (d/catch Exception (fn [_] ""))
    
;; the above returns a deferred whose realised value will be either the body of the message or an empty string
```

## To Do

Here's a few things I haven't gotten to yet, mostly because I didn't need them in my specific use case. If you'd like to dive in an help on these, that would much appreciated!

1. Sending email is very basic at the moment (to, subject, body): no bcc, no cc, no multiple addresses bcc / cc / to.
2. All endpoints are hard-coded to the "me" authorized email identifier at this time.
3. Email attachments!!
